[**True Sight**][1]
====================

[![badass cat iris](stuff/eye.png)][1]

This Firefox extension aims to expose today's most omnipresent agents on the Internet: *Content Delivery Networks (CDN)*.

Never heard of CDN? As it turns out, most of the global internet traffic goes through CDN so seamlessly that the majority of the population never even notices. These third parties are hired by website owners *(often for "free"!)*, and their role in this ecosystem is that of messengers. They have many eyes, many hands, and they are *everywhere*. Trying to avoid them completely is not really an option anymore. They're so widespread already, that one would have to actually stop using a massive chunk of the Internet entirely in order to steer clear of them.

**... but *that* shouldn't make them any more acceptable, in my humble opinion.**

That being said, I don't want to tell you what to do, nor whom to trust. Your newfound True Sight power alone will not save you from anyone, but it will hopefully bring you awareness. I think we all deserve to at least **know** when some giant corporate ninja is sitting right between us and the real servers that we so innocently *try* to visit everyday. How you use this power is up to you.
